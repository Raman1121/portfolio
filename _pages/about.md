Hi! I am Raman Dutt, a recent graduate in Computer Science from [Shiv Nadar University, India](https://snu.edu.in/). I am interested in both theoretical and applicative deep learning. Theoretically, I am interested in different pretraining strategies for computer vision tasks in different domains. On the applicative side, I enjoy working on Medical Imaging and Cheminformatics problems. I was fortunate enough to serve as **the president of the ACM chapter** and also the **Student Lead for the Developer Student Club (DSC)** at Shiv Nadar University. Presently, I am working as a research intern at the [Healthcare Innovation and Translational Informatics lab (HITI)](http://hitilab.org/) at Emory University under Dr. Hari Trivedi. In the past, I have worked with Dr. N Sukumar on Cheminformatics (Drug Activity Prediction), Dr. GPS Raghava on classification of proteins and Dr. Tavpritesh Sethi on detection of Hemodynamic Shock. 

Apart from this, I am very closely attached to music and obtained a **Grade 3 certification in guitar from Trinity School of Music, London** in the past. In recent times, I have developed a passion for different forms of exercises (weight training and calisthenics) and can be often found experimenting with different workout mixes.
